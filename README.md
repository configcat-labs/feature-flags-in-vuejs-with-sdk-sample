# How To Use Feature Flags in Vue.js

This app is a companion sample app for the article: [How To Use Feature Flags in Vue.js](https://configcat.com/blog/2022/01/28/how-to-use-feature-flag-in-vuejs/).

## Application's Functionality

If the "calculateuseragefeature" flag is enabled in the [ConfigCat dashboard](https://app.configcat.com), the 'Calculate Your Age' feature becomes available. In this case, an input field appears, allowing users to calculate their age based on their birth year. However, if the feature flag is disabled, a message informs the user that the feature has been turned off by the admin.

## Project setup

1. Install the npm dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

2. Run the app locally in development mode:

```sh
npm run dev
```
