# How To Use Feature Flags in Vue.js

This app is a companion application for the [How To Use Feature Flags in Vue.js](https://configcat.com/blog/2022/01/28/how-to-use-feature-flag-in-vuejs/) blog post

## Application's Functionality

If the "calculateUserAgeFeature" flag is enabled in the ConfigCat dashboard, the "Calculate Your Age" feature becomes available for use. In this case, an input field appears, allowing users to calculate their age based on their birth year. However, if the feature flag is toggled off, a message is displayed informing the user that the feature is currently disabled by the admin.

## Project setup

1. Install the npm dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

2. Run the app locally in development mode:

```sh
npm run dev
```
